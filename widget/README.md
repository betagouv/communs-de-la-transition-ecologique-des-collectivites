# Les Communs Widget

A React widget that displays associated services for ecological transition projects. This widget is designed to be embedded in various platforms to provide a consistent service discovery experience.

## Features

- Displays services associated with a project
- Responsive design using DSFR (Design System de l'Ã‰tat)
- TypeScript support
- Built with Vite

## Usage in Other Projects

To use this widget in your project:

```bash
pnpm add @betagouv/les-communs-widget
```

Then import and use the component:

```tsx
import { ServicesWidget } from "@betagouv/les-communs-widget";

function App() {
  return <ServicesWidget projectId="your-project-id" />;
}
```

### Staging environment

You can test against the staging environment by passing prop `isStagingEnv`:

```tsx
import { ServicesWidget } from "@betagouv/les-communs-widget";

function App() {
  return <ServicesWidget projectId="your-project-id" isStagingEnv />;
}
```

### Test Configuration

If you encounter an error related to unknown file extensions in your test (e.g., `.css`), you may need to adjust your Vite configuration. Add the following to your `vite.config.ts` file.

The inlined package will be processed and bundled directly into the application rather than being treated as an external dependency. This is particularly useful for dependencies that include non-JavaScript assets (like CSS).

```
// ... existing code ...
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    deps: {
      inline: ['@betagouv/les-communs-widget'], // Ensure this dependency is processed correctly
    },
  },
  // ... existing code ...
});
```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 20)
- pnpm (>= 9.x)
- Running instance of Les Communs API (see api/README.md)

### Setup

1. First, build the widget:

```bash
cd les-communs-widget
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

2. Then, set up the sandbox environment:

```bash
cd ../les-communs-widget-widget-sandbox
pnpm install
```

### Development Workflow

1. Start the API (in a separate terminal):

```bash
cd api
pnpm start:dev
```

2. Start the sandbox development server:

```bash
cd les-communs-widget-widget-sandbox
pnpm dev
```

The sandbox will automatically reload when you make changes to the widget code.

### Testing Your Changes

1. When you want to test your changes, you need to publish the widget locally (we use yalc):

```bash
pnpm dev:widget:publish
```

2. Link the widget sandbox to the published yalc package

```bash
pnpm dev:widget-sandbox:link
```

3. Should you make further updates run the below command to avoid having to re-link the widget sandbox

```bash
pnpm dev:widget:push
```

4. When your testing is done, unlink the widget sandbox

```bash
pnpm dev:widget-sandbox:unlink
```

## Publishing

1. Increase the version number in your package json
2. Update the file CHANGELOG.md accordingly
3. Publish through script below (this will build the widget beforehand)

   ```bash
   pnpm release
   ```
