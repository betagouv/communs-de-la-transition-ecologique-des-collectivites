# Communs de la transition écologique des collectivités


**Les Communs** are a project that has 2 main objectives :

- "dites-le nous une fois" : make sure that a project entered on a platform is available on other platforms. 
- help with service deployment by making services discoverable through the project page on the different platforms

To achieve those objectives, there are 2 main components :

- an API / database to centralize project information  ([API documentation](api/README.md))
- a front widget responsible for linking project with services ([Widget documentation](les-communs-widget/README.md))

Roadmap is here : (ask for permission to access it if you do not have it yet) https://github.com/orgs/betagouv/projects/129/views/2
